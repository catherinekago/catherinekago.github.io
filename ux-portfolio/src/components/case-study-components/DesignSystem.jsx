            To understand the challenges of our current structures, I gathered
            insights from the users of our design system, namely my design
            colleagues. I further mapped out the current component release
            process and design system structure and did research on existing
            design systems to build a solid understanding for further
            exploration of possible solutions to address the design teamâ€™s
            needs.

            The outcome of my initial research was a clear goal: to enhance the
            design system and associated processes to improve transparency and
            alignment on existing and emerging UI components. With the goal
            defined, it was now time to explore possible approaches to achieve
            it. My design mentor and I decided to continue by preparing a
            workshop for the whole design team to collectively refine the
            requirements and evaluate first solution approaches.

            We did a debrief on our workshop and revised our follow-up tasks.
            Our next steps included a refined proposal for the new design system
            structure and its implementation, providing a documentation template
            for custom components and introduce the finalized component release
            process to the team and promote it within our weekly design system
            meeting.

            When I introduced the design system and our component release
            process to new design team members, they were consistently surprised
            by the simplicity and the self-explanatory structure and process.
            Nevertheless, we identified new challenges as we progressed. We were
            lacking the role of a design system lead who was responsible for the
            evaluation of new component requests. This slowed down the decision
            and release process and created uncertainty. Also, our process
            proposal did not cover the actual implementation, which means that
            misalignment and double-work were still likely to happen within the
            implementation of components. This project taught me that we as
            designers should regularly evaluate the structures we are working
            with to find opportunitites to improve our workflow.
