Within a short period of time, the number of our designers also increased, and it soon became clear that existing structures had to be adapted to the requirements of the growing design team. In addition to my role as UX designer for a specific digital product, I took on the task of identifying the design teamâ€™s requirements for our design system and associated processes, exploring possible solutions, and implementing the approach that addressed our needs best."

We saw the need to improve our current workflow to keep each other in the loop early on in the process of evolving existing components and introducing new ones. On top of that, the structure of our existing design system was not prepared for the anticipated increase of complexity and amount of components."
  const solution = "I introduced three main adaptation to our current design system and associated processes: an overhaul of our design system structure, templates to facilitate documentation of components, and a release process for new components to improve transparency and alignment within the design team."
