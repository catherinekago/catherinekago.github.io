Her strength lies in asking the right questions at the right time, bringing focus and clarity to tasks. She demonstrates creativity and out-of-the-box thinking in prototyping, and her execution is unmatched. Kathrin designs with speed and quality while effectively communicating her intentions, process, and decisions at every stage. She is not only a talented designer but also a wonderful person, empathetic towards team members and dedicated to fostering a positive and enjoyable working environment."
